                <h2>Freddie Mercury</h2>
                <p> Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara; 5 September 1946 – 24 November 1991) was a British singer,
                    songwriter, record producer and lead vocalist of the rock band Queen. Regarded as one of the
                    greatest lead singers in the history of rock music, he was known for his flamboyant stage
                    persona and four-octave vocal range.

                    Born in 1946 in Zanzibar to Parsi parents from India, he attended English-style boarding schools in
                    India from the age of eight, and returned to Zanzibar after secondary school. In 1964, his family
                    fled the Zanzibar Revolution, moving to Middlesex, England. Having studied and written music for
                    years, he formed Queen in 1970 with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor. Mercury wrote
                    numerous hits for Queen, including "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Killer Queen", "Somebody to Love", "Don't
                    Stop Me Now", "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", and "We Are the Champions". He also led a solo
                    career and served as a producer and guest musician for other artists. Mercury died in 1991 at age 45
                    due to complications from AIDS. He confirmed the day before his death that he had contracted the
                    disease.

                    As a member of Queen, Mercury was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001,
                    the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. In 1990, he and the
                    band Queen were awarded the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. In 1992, a
                    tribute concert was held at Wembley Stadium, London. In 2002, Mercury ranked as number 58 in the
                    BBC's 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. The 2018 film about Mercury and Queen, Bohemian
                    Rhapsody, is the highest-grossing musical biographical film of all time. Rami Malek won the Academy
                    Award for Best Actor for his performance as Mercury in the film, among critical praise and other
                    accolades.</p>

                <h2>Brian May</h2>
                <p>Brian Harold May, CBE (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician, singer, songwriter, and
                    astrophysicist. He is best known as the lead guitarist of the rock band Queen. He uses a home-built
                    electric guitar called the Red Special. His compositions for the band include "We Will Rock You",
                    "Tie Your Mother Down", "I Want It All", "Fat Bottomed Girls" and many more.

                    May was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer Freddie Mercury and drummer Roger Taylor, having
                    previously performed with Taylor in the band Smile, which he had joined while he was at university.
                    Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player John Deacon
                    completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success
                    of the album A Night at the Opera and its single "Bohemian Rhapsody". From the mid-1970s until the
                    early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest
                    venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at Live Aid in 1985. As a member
                    of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound
                    created through his layered guitar work.

                    Following the death of Mercury in 1991, Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were
                    eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists. In 2005,
                    a Planet Rock poll saw May voted the seventh greatest guitarist of all time. In 2012, he was ranked
                    the second greatest guitarist in a Guitar World magazine readers poll. In 2001, he was inducted
                    into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Queen and in 2018 the band received the Grammy
                    Lifetime Achievement Award.

                    May was appointed a CBE by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005 for "services to the music industry and for
                    charity work". May earned a PhD in astrophysics from Imperial College London in 2007. He was a
                    "science team
                    collaborator" with NASA's New Horizons Pluto mission. Asteroid 52665 Brianmay was named after
                    him.</p>

                <h2>Roger Taylor</h2>
                <p>Roger Meddows Taylor (born 26 July 1949) is an English musician, singer, songwriter, and
                multi-instrumentalist, best known as the drummer for the rock band Queen. As a drummer, Taylor was
                recognised early in his career for his unique sound. He was voted by radio listeners as the
                eighth-greatest drummer in classic rock music history in a poll conducted by Planet Rock in 2005.

                As a songwriter, Taylor contributed songs to Queen's albums from the beginning, composing at least one
                track on every album, and often singing lead vocals on his own compositions. He wrote or co-wrote three
                UK number 1s ("These Are the Days of Our Lives", "Innuendo" and "Under Pressure") and contributed a
                further five major hits ("Radio Ga Ga", "A Kind of Magic", "Heaven for Everyone", "Breakthru", and "The
                Invisible Man"). He is also the main writer on the international top-ten hit "One Vision", although
                the track is credited to the whole band. He has collaborated with such artists as Eric Clapton, Roger
                Waters,Phil Collins, Genesis, Jimmy Nail, Elton John, Gary Numan, Shakin'
                Stevens, Foo Fighters, Al Stewart, Steve Vai, Yoshiki, Cyndi Almouzni, and Bon Jovi. As a producer, he
                has produced albums by Virginia Wolf, Jimmy Nail and Magnum.
                Taylor is also well known for his
                falsetto vocal range.</p>

                <h2>John Deacon</h2>
                <p>John Richard Deacon (born 19 August 1951) is an English retired musician, best known for being the bass
                guitarist for the rock band Queen. He composed several songs for the group—including Top 10 hits "You're
                My Best Friend", "Another One Bites the Dust", "Back Chat", and "I Want to Break Free"—and was involved
                in the band's financial management.

                Deacon grew up in Oadby, Leicestershire, playing bass in a local band, The Opposition, before moving to
                study electronics at Chelsea College, London. He joined Queen in 1971 on the strength of his musical and
                electronic skills, particularly the home-made Deacy Amp which guitarist Brian May used to create guitar
                orchestras throughout Queen's career. From the third album, Sheer Heart Attack, onwards, he wrote at
                least one song per album, several of which became hits. As well as bass, Deacon played some guitar and
                keyboards on Queen's studio work.

                After the death of lead singer Freddie Mercury in 1991 and the following year's Tribute Concert, Deacon
                performed only sporadically with the remaining members of Queen before retiring from the music industry
                in 1997 after recording "No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)". He has not performed on any of the
                other projects that the other two surviving members, Brian May and Roger Taylor, have put together.</p>
