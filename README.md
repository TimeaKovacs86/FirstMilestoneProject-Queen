# Queen 

## About the Project:

This website was made as my first Milestone project at Code Institute. My goal was to create a responsive, user centric frontend website using the HTML5 and CSS3 technologies. On this website the user can navigate between the pages easily and they can use the website on every device as a result of responsive design and implementation.

 - During this project I had to create a website for a band, and my choice was the rock-band Queen. Since the website is a static (front-end-only) site, we have narrow options to use it:
   - Check the website on every device easily
   - Navigate between the pages
   - Find information about the band members
   - Listen few of the most famous songs of the band and watch video clip ( I choose this video because it's a live concert video from the year I was born in the city where my family lives.) 
   - Get information about their tour:
     - When will be the next concerts
     - Where will be the next concerts
     - We are able to navigate to the websites where we can actually buy ticket to those concerts with the buy ticket button on the events page
   - Send request for the band if we would like to invite them or ask them to participate in charity or fund events
   - Check the band social sites

 
## Mockups

## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

Because of lack of technology and knowledge (learned only HTML5, CSS3) you only can navigate between the pages and you can reach the outer social sites, as well the actual ticket selling websites for the bands upcoming events. The main feature for thsi project is the responsive design and implementation of the user centric development.

### Existing Features

 - Responsive:
   - Every page is responsive, usable and looks good on the below resolution:
     - Phones less than 768px
     - Tablets 768px and over
     - Desktops 992px and over
     - Large desktops 1200px and over
 
 
 - Social links
   - Every icon of the social section is a link to the band official site on that social media site (will open in a new browser window):
     - Facebook
     - Twitter
     - Youtube
     - Spotify
     - Instagram
     
 - Hover effects:
   - On the navigation elements
   - On the buttons
   - On the social links 
   
 - Buy tickets:
   - Works as a link to the ticket selling website
   
 - Send Request:
   - Required fields, mandatory and required format when you fill the form and want to send it        
 
     

### Features Left to Implement

 - "Send Request"function need to have JavaScript and jQuery technology.

## Technologies Used

 
     

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
